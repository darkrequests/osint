# Instagram Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape Instagram follower data for a specified username. You can authenticate using your session ID, retrieve a list of followers, and even search through the data for specific details, such as phone numbers. The script also provides options for saving the scraped data in JSON format and adjusting the scraping behavior through command-line arguments.

## Features

- **Login using Session ID**: Authenticate using your Instagram session ID.
- **Scrape Followers**: Retrieve a specified number of followers for a target username.
- **Search by Phone Number**: Search through the scraped user data to find specific phone numbers (note: this is hypothetical as Instagram typically does not expose phone numbers).
- **Flexible CLI**: Command-line interface to customize the scraping process.
- **Save Data**: Save scraped user data to a JSON file for further analysis.
- **Configurable Delay**: Add a delay between requests to avoid rate limiting or bans from Instagram.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors like login failures, missing data, or file-related issues.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed.
- `requests` library installed.

You can install the required library with the following command:

```bash
pip install requests
